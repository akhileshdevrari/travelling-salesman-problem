### Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated annealing
TSP is a very popular problem in computer science. 
*Problem Statement:* There are N cities, and a salesman has to visit each city exactly once. He is not concerned about the order of visit. Distance between each pair of cities is known. Find an order in which the salesman should visit the cities such that he has to travel minimum distance.

The TSP problem is proved to be NP-hard. This means no polynomial-time algorithm is known to get optimal solution. We, however, can try to find good solutions. This is basically an optimization problem with goal to minimize the distance travelled by the salesman.

*Simulated Annealing:* It is a stochastic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Please read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).

This is project is a part of an assignment in "Artificial Intelligence" course at IIT Mandi. Here we have used Simulated Annealing algorithm to optimize the TSP problem.
